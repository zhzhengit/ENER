## E-NER: Evidential Deep Learning for Trustworthy Named Entity Recognition

This repository contains the code for our paper [E-NER: Evidential Deep Learning for Trustworthy Named Entity Recognition](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.103/) (ACL Findings, 2023).

## Overview

We study the problem of trustworthy NER by leveraging evidential deep learning. To address the issues of sparse entities and OOV/OOD entities, we propose E-NER with two uncertainty-guided loss terms. The uncertainty estimation quality of E-NER is improved without harming performance. Additionally, the well-qualified uncertainties contribute to detecting OOV/OOD, generalization, and sample selection.
